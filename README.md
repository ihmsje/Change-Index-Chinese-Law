# Change-Index-Chinese-Law

This change index measures the textual difference between two versions of the same Chinese law. For example, it can measure the difference between the 2015 and the 2021 revision of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law (or any other law).

It was developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis: 

"Who, What, When, How? Inter-Agency Fragmentation and Coordination in China's African Swine Fever Crisis."
